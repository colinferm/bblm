**Blood Bowl League Manager**
For those who want to run a league or tournament, BBLM is here for you, compliant with the 2020 rules for all players.

The project is currently in development but the plans for it are as follows
1. Will host as many leagues and divisions as one can imagine.
2. Will allow for multiple seasons with configurable re-drafting rules (or just continuations)
3. Will allow for configurable season championships.
4. Will validate teams and player improvements.
5. Can generate random skill or stat improvements (configurable).
6. Should be compatible with BB7s.

And much much more.

This was built as a hobby and will be maintained as such but suggestions for improvement made politely will always be considered.

And, it goes without saying that Blood Bowl is the property of Games Workshop (GW). This software is not endorsed in anyway by GW.
